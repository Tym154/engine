# Engine

An experimental software 3D renderer written in C++ and SDL.
Everything runs on the CPU, from projection to rasterization, no GPU, no OpenGL, no DirectX.
Itâ€™s a personal side project for learning the fundamentals of rendering and engine architecture.

(Gonna make some kind of GPU parallelization later into the project)
